# Automated-Identification-of-Mod-Sev-TBI-Lesions

The following project is for the challenge of [Grand Challenge](https://aims-tbi.grand-challenge.org/)
Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (msTBI) is caused by external forces leading to complex brain pathophysiological changes, resulting in heterogeneous lesions that are a hallmark of msTBI. These lesions, which differ significantly from other brain pathologies like stroke and tumors, can be both focal and diffuse, complicating neuroimaging processes such as image registration and brain parcellation. While various tools exist for lesion compensation in neuroimaging, many require manual intervention and are often ineffective for TBI-specific lesions. Existing TBI-specific algorithms either need multiple image types or are limited to CT scans, restricting large-scale MRI data aggregation. Therefore, this challenge focuses on T1-weighted MRI data, aiming to advance lesion segmentation and improve subsequent image processing, which can enhance prognostication and long-term outcomes for msTBI patients.

Goals: 
- Improve lesion segmentation techniques.
- Integrate accurate lesion masks into subsequent image processing and analyses (e.g., parcellation, functional connectivity analyses, connectomics, fixel-based analysis).
